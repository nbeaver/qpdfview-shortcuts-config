Keyboard shortcuts for qpdfview
===============================

The `qpdfview`_ PDF reader is a Poppler-based pdf reader with tabs.

The default keybindings are a little clunky, however, so here are my customized configuration, including:

- Vim-like ``hjkl`` and arrow keys both work.
- Search with ``/``, as in Vim.
- Close tab with ``d``, as in `Pentadactyl`_ and `Vimperator`_.
- Search next with enter, like most browsers.
- Move to other tabs with Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn as well as Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab, like most browsers.
- Zoom in with Ctrl+= and out with Ctrl+-, like most browsers.

To use it, replace the qpdfview config file, usually in ``~/.config/qpdfview/shortcuts.conf``.
You can keep your old config file by e.g. renaming ``shortcuts.conf`` to ``shotcuts.conf.old``.
